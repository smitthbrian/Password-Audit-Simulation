Password Audit Simulation Project - IT Auditing and Cybersecurity Analytics

This project simulates a Web Access Logs Audit for Superior Schedules, aimed at demonstrating my knowledge and understanding of auditing and analytics. The assignment involved conducting a mock audit to evaluate potential probing activities and indicators of compromise within the company's web access logs.

Through this simulation, I analyzed various web access patterns and identified vulnerabilities, particularly focusing on known threats such as AndroxGh0st and SYSTEMBC. The findings highlight critical insights into the security posture of the organization and underscore the importance of proactive measures to protect against sophisticated attacks.

Key Features:

Methodology: Reviews password policies, account recovery processes, session management, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementations.

Findings: Identifies compliance strengths and security vulnerabilities, particularly in the use of cryptographic practices.

Recommendations: Proposes actionable steps to enhance security, including ongoing monitoring and user training.

This project serves as a valuable resource for understanding best practices in password management and improving organizational security measures.
