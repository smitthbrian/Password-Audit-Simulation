Password Audit Simulation Project - IT Infrastructure and Auditing

This course project involves a comprehensive password audit simulation aimed at evaluating digital identity management systems against NIST Special Publication 800-63B guidelines. It focuses on two case studies: the Superior Scheduling Home Page and Ashley Madison.

Key Features:

Methodology: Reviews password policies, account recovery processes, session management, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementations.

Findings: Identifies compliance strengths and security vulnerabilities, particularly in the use of cryptographic practices.

Recommendations: Proposes actionable steps to enhance security, including ongoing monitoring and user training.

This project serves as a valuable resource for understanding best practices in password management and improving organizational security measures.
